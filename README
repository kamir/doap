Description of a Dataset
========================

DOAD is a project to create an XML/RDF vocabulary to describe datasets. 

It does not matter if a dataset is available for download as a  ZIP archive, containing multiple 
spreadsheets or if it is a large HBase table, stored in a Hadoop cluster. DOAD files are used to expose metadata 
about data sets, without opening the technical environment.

In an ideal world, all scientific publications would reference a public DOAD file, which contains relevant metadata in
a machine readable form.

This project is an addition to the DOAP project, which also aims to
provide tool support in all the popular programming languages.

During the first project phase, the focus of DOAD is on building a reusable schema and a set of example DOAD files
for public data sets.
