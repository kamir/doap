DOAD: Description of a Dataset
------------------------------

DOAD is a project to create an XML/RDF vocabulary to describe datasets. 

It does not matter if a dataset is available as a downloadable ZIP archive which contains documents, e.g. multiple 
spreadsheets or if it is a large HBase table, stored in a Hadoop cluster. DOAD files are used to expose metadata 
about data sets, without any impact on the cluster environment. There are no additional user accounts nor  
public access to the cluster or file server required.

Based on DOAP files, aninterconnected layer of data set descriptors will be created and spread across the web.
In an ideal world, all scientific publications would reference public DOAD files, which contain relevant metadata 
about all used data sets in a machine readable form. Access to the raw data is not considered. The metadata layser
is only required for consistency checks and for communication purposses. Based on contact details which are part of 
the dataset descriptor, access conditions can be negotiated by humans. Information about public access is also part 
of the metadata, this way the approach is open for public open data sets as well as for internal private data.

This project was inspired and is based on the "DOAP project", which also aims on providing tool support in all the 
popular programming languages.

During the first project phase, the focus of DOAD is on building a reusable metadata schema and a set of example DOAD 
files for public data sets.
